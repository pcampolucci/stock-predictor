# Stock Prediction Tool
This tool has been developed to support traders actively involved in traditional stock markets. The tool is tailored to unlock superior insights for mid-term strategies (1 to 3 months). 
Our algorithm retreives data from two sources. Firstly, all reliable news repositories (eg. Yahoo Finance, Investing.com ....) are screened by the scanning tool to consolidate relevant information. Secondly the historical trends of stocks are plotted and numerically correlated with fundamentals such as Forex trends, Commodities trends and Sentiment index trends. The tool generates predictions of stock behaviours out of these 3 pillars thanks to correlation matrixes organized in a RNN infrastructure.
